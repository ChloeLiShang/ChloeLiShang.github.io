                <div id='about'>
                    <p>I'm a student at the University of Alberta majoring in Computing Science with specialization in Software Practice. I'm going into my fourth year this fall.</p>
                    <p>I have participated in two hackathon events in my third year. The first time was just to see what a hackathon is and the second time I actually made an app with my friends that I am proud of (you can check it out <a href='https://devpost.com/software/restaurant-finder-otug5w' target='_blank'>here</a>).</p>
                    <p>I am currently taking online web development courses so this website is actually my personal project. Just something to practice the stuff I learned and to play around with. I'm excited about this!</p>
                    <p>I just made an app with other students this winter for a school project. It's an Uber-like app. I was responsible for the UI design and the implementation on the rider side. And additional stuff like solving merge conflicts and fixing bugs. Check out the <a href='https://github.com/CMPUT301W20T21/InstantCab' target='_blank'>project</a> on GitHub!</p>

                <h2>What I Do For Fun</h2>
                <p>In my spare time, I would play games like League of Legends, Dead By Daylight, GTA, and sometimes other games (I'm a fan of Rusty Lake games!). If you are interested in playing with me, add me!</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>On league: RaccoonCS</li>
                    <li>On steam: 1005192614</li>
                    <li>My social club: BearForce7</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Besides playing games, I'm also learning guitar. I'm a beginner guitar player haha.</p>
